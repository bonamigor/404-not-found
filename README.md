- <strong>Where can I see your demo?</strong>
  - To see my demo you just have to go to > [404](http://github.com/bonamigor) and resize the browser's window and see the responsive page working!
- <strong>What was your experience?</strong>
  - It was pretty good to have the figma's layout to use it as my start point, so I basically followed the 'instructions'
- <strong>What have you learned/improved?</strong>
  - I've improved my knowledge on how responsive pages work and how to organize better the HTML so responsive pages doesn't become nightmares
